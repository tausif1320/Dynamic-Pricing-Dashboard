# Dynamic-Pricing-Dashboard
# ðŸ“Š Dynamic Pricing & Revenue Optimization Dashboard â€“ Power BI  

## ðŸ”¹ Business Problem  
Retail businesses often rely on **static pricing strategies**, which fail to adapt to:  
- Seasonal demand fluctuations  
- Customer buying behavior  
- Inventory levels  

This results in lost revenue opportunities and poor forecasting.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Goal of the Dashboard  
The main objective of this project is to:  
- Build a **dynamic pricing simulator** using Power BI.  
- Allow executives to monitor **key KPIs** in real-time.  
- Simulate **price adjustments (+/- %)** and measure revenue impact.  
- Provide insights by **category, region, and time trends**.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Dataset  
- Rows: **128,976**  
- Columns used:  
  - `Order ID`  
  - `Date` (cleaned & standardized)  
  - `Category`  
  - `Quantity`  
  - `Amount`  
  - `Ship State`  
- Preprocessing: Cleaned in **Python (Pandas)** and **Excel** to handle mixed date formats and remove unnecessary columns.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Visuals  

1. **KPI Cards**  
   - Metrics: Total Revenue, Total Orders, Average Order Value, Adjusted Revenue.  
   - ðŸ“Œ Provides an executive snapshot.  

2. **Revenue vs Adjusted Revenue (Bar/Line Chart)**  
   - ðŸ“Œ Shows effect of price adjustments.  

3. **Category-wise Sales (Bar Chart)**  
   - ðŸ“Œ Identifies top-performing product categories.  

4. **Geo Heatmap (State-wise Sales)**  
   - ðŸ“Œ Highlights strong and weak regions.  

5. **Order Status (Donut Chart)**  
   - ðŸ“Œ Tracks Delivered vs Cancelled orders.  

6. **Trend Analysis (Line Chart)**  
   - ðŸ“Œ Seasonality, monthly, and quarterly growth.  

7. **Tooltips & Drillthrough Pages**  
   - ðŸ“Œ Detailed insights without cluttering main visuals.
